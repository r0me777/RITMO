# RITMO
This is a program based on the RITMO algirthom. Used to allocate tasks between nodes. 
For a broader sense this is based off the scientifc paper, Titled "Resource Inference for Task Migration in Challenged Edge Networks with RITMO" by Alessio Sacco; Flavio Esposito; Guido Marchetto. It generates task aka (x,y) values from 0-100 to simulate a virtual 100 by 100 x,y map. Puts them all into a big list and randomly breaks them into lists of 3-7. These lists are then given to the nodes which complete tasks based on the aligorthim in the scientific paper. Bascially, having a queue max of 5 tasks per node if a node was assigned 6 or 7 then it would give a node that has space the task, or if it had space it would take the current amount of tasks in the nodes and add 1. This is the predictive element of the program and if this rings turn then it will randomly give the a node a task. After all conditions have been meet, it will then "move" to the points in the task list. By moving it just will put the tasks in the tasklist to a list called "positions". After ever node has moved every task to its position the program ends. There are bugs, and the aligorthim is not as complex as from the Paper but the concept is the same.
